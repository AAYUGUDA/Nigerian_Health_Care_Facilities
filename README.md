# Nigerian_Health_Care_Facilities

## Problem Statement:

The healthcare system in Nigeria, as depicted in the dashboard, faces several challenges. These include disparities in the distribution of functional facilities across the country with an estimated 213.4 million people , a high number of non-functional facilities, and a concentration of functional facilities in certain regions like Lagos.

## Objective:

The objective is to use the insights from the dashboard to improve the distribution and functionality of healthcare facilities across Nigeria. This involves increasing the number of functional facilities, reducing the number of non-functional ones, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare services for all citizens.

## Findings:

According to the dashboard, it appears that there is variation in the distribution of healthcare facilities across Nigeria. Some regions have better access to healthcare services than others. Additionally, there are facilities throughout the country. Operational facilities are mainly concentrated in areas like Lagos, which poses accessibility difficulties for people living in other regions.
