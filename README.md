# Nigerian_Health_Care_Facilities

## Problem Statement:

The healthcare system in Nigeria, as depicted in the dashboard, faces several challenges. These include disparities in the distribution of functional facilities across the country with an estimated 213.4 million people , a high number of non-functional facilities, and a concentration of functional facilities in certain regions like Lagos.

## Objective:

The objective is to use the insights from the dashboard to improve the distribution and functionality of healthcare facilities across Nigeria. This involves increasing the number of functional facilities, reducing the number of non-functional ones, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare services for all citizens.

## Findings:

The dashboard reveals that there is a significant disparity in the distribution of functional healthcare facilities across Nigeria, with certain regions having more access to healthcare services than others. Additionally, there is a high number of non-functional facilities across the country. Furthermore, functional facilities are concentrated in certain areas like Lagos, leading to accessibility issues for those living in other regions.
